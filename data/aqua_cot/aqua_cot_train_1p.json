This means that your goal is to get the equations in terms of B and J so that you can solve for the expression B - J.\nTaking the first equation and solving for B, you have B = M - 1.\nTaking the second equation and solving for J you have J = W - 3, and then with the third equation you can replace W with 3 + M so that both B and J are in terms of M: J = (3 + M) - 3.\nSo if B = M - 1 and J = M, then:\nB - J = (M - 1) - (M)\nB - J = M - 1 - M (remove the parentheses by distributing the multiplication)\nB - J = -1, so the answer is D.",

Set up the equation and solve:\n550 + (0.08)(x – 2,000) = 0.10x\nDistribute the 0.08:\n550 + 0.08x – 160 = 0.10x\nCombine terms and subtract 0.08x from both sides:\n390 = 0.02x\nDivide both sides by 0.02:\n19,500 = x\nYour answer is A.",
